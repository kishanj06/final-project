                <h2>Knives Out</h2>
                <p>Surprisingly good film. The built up of the suspense really makes this movie is what it is. I really liked how this movie raised questions and left me wondering what was going to happen next.</p>

                    <h2>Beautiful Boy</h2>
                    <p> This movie is very emotional. It speaks to drug addiction and how it affects families as a whole. This movie can be a "tear jerker" for some. Even the way the movie is filmed and edited adds to the sentiment of the movie.</p>

                <h2>The Pursuit of Happyness</h2>
                <p>My all time favorite movie. Will Smith plays his character very passionately. This movie is also an emotional one that leaves me thinking about it even after watching it. I loved every moment of the movie as there wasn't a scene where I lost interest.  </p>
