                <h2>It Ends With Us</h2>
                <p>Well written novel. Spent hours reading it at a time, it's that interesting! Everything from the characters to the plot/stroyline, this read was worth it. Also, a good read that will have you feeling different emotions.</p>

                    <h2>The Nickel Boys</h2>
                    <p>Although this book was a short read, this was a read that kept it real. With serious topics being discussed, this truly appealed to my emotions. Some parts of the novel were hard to digest but doesn't take away from the book as a whole.</p>

                <h2>A Good Girl's Guide To Murder</h2>
                <p>Mystery books are a favorite of mine. The title alone peeked my interest and as I read i grew to like the storyline. Would definitely read the other books that are apart of the series. </p>
